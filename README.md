<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
ZillaPot is a virtual crypto casino built for the Zilliqa chain. The concept revolves around pots. The idea is a user creates a pot which starts a clock, when this clock expires the last person to deposit gets the whole pot. The catch is that there is an minimum deposit amount which increases each deposit aswell as the remaining time increases per deposit.


# Project goals
* Provide a fun dapp for Zilliqa users to interact with the community and have fun. 
* Increase Zilliqa's network engagment and trading volume.
* Draw in more ZillaPot and Zilliqa user by prompting to share to web 2.0 social platforms.

# Features
* Ability to view, create, claim and deposit to pots.
* Share your winning moments on web 2.0 social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and more.
* Login with ZilPay.
* Carefully crafted and gorgeous design which is filled to the brim with many small details to enhance the user experience.
* Profile page to view your stats
* Pots page to view all pots

# Pages
## Landing page
A gorgeous landing page welcomes the user to ZillaPot. From here the user can log in with their ZilPay account and by scrolling down get a quick understanding of the app.

## Pots screen
The pot screen is the main page of ZillaPot. Here a user can view all the pots created on ZillaPot with powerful sorting tools.
The user can view pots by categories such as:
* All pots
* Active pots

* Joined pots
* Won pots
* Lost pots

And sort them by: 
* Total pot value
* Buy-in amount
* Time left
* Contributions

Clicking on a pot will open the pot buy page.
